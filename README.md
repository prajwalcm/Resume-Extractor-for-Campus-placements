How to ensure you have the Appropriate Candidate in the right jobs at the right time. This is a significant problem faced by large companies today in the market.
<br/><br/>
This system uses data mining for extracting resumes from multiple job platforms. Project consists of a job post and resume classification system based on coupling an integrated skills knowledge base and an automatic matching procedure between candidate resumes and their corresponding job postings. The proposed system first utilizes a section-based segmentation module in order to segment the resumes and extract a set of skills that are used in the classification process.
